	"description":"When we hear a song/composition, what we get to witness is just the tip of the iceberg. What goes on to create the final product is much larger a process that the listeners never get to know. Taking that into consideration, this project takes you a bit closer to real efforts and multiple tasks undertaken in giving shape to a song.The very notion was to bring the whole process of creating a song to the knowledge of the listeners in a very interesting audio visual series that would benefit both the normal listeners as well as budding musicians. TBBT is elated to have worked with Susmit Sen Chronicles. A series of episodes highlights the various stages that an idea evolves through before finally developing into a Song. Each episode reflects different elements and aspects attached in building an original composition, from its inception to its culmination.Feel the music!",
