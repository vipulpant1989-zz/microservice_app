Yet, underneath their quiet veneer lies a sonorous ability to showcase a platter of different regional folk songs from India within an urban palette. The rich melodious folk culture of the South Asian Diaspora when infused with subtle essence of urban western arrangements, help their compositions to connect with the voice within. Their first official release “Folk Foundation Vol I” has already received critical accolade and helped enhance their global stature.",

An ability to appreciate each others diverse lyrical tastes, helps them to devour any differences, whilst traversing on a musical journey, replete with unmitigated frolic. Translating their ability to work long into mellifluous nights, on the stage, they are able to cover different artitsts like Jet, James Brown, and A R Rahman in the same gig. A feat worth waxing lyrical bout. They have shared the stage with acclaimed artists like Susmit Sen Chronicles, Agnee, Parikrama and Baiju Dharamajan. An ensemble cast comprising of Jasjit, the lead guitarist specializing in Blues providing the most heart-throbbing topping of solos and riffs to their songs, Siddharth, the drummer boy who loves to play funk while sharing the vocalists love for odd time signatures, and Bhavya, the frontman who acts as the vocalist and rhythm guy, heps create a wonder musical mosaic.",

It POPs with the rock, the roll, the blues and the soul…and everything in between.The band came together in 2011, when singer-songwriter Manta Sidhu set out to look for musicians to bring to life the songs she had been writing. Featuring Jishnu Banerjee on guitar, Shivam Khare on keys, Rahul Rai on bass and Reuben Narain on drums – MAP’s journey over the last 4 years has been spirited, spontaneous and rewarding. The band released its debut album 'Rear View' with major record label Times Music in July 2013. Presently, the 5 member line-up is busy recording and releasing a bunch of audio and video singles.

Having performed in over 300 shows alongside acclaimed artists such as Vishal and Shekhar, Kailash Kher, Mohit Chauhan, KK, Shaan, Aditi Singh Sharma etc. they have swayed audiences irrespective of their geographical affiliations. They recently crossed the borders into Kabul, Afganisthan where they made audiences groove at the 'Vote for Peace' concert. An ardent advocate of synthesising fresh medleys and having fun while seemingly at ‘work’ has cemented their legacy as the harbingers of hindi-pop, within the nation. ",
